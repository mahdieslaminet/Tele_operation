# Teleoperation Project with OpenCV and BionicHand
# Overview
# This project aims to create a teleoperation system using OpenCV for computer vision and a BionicHand for robotic control. The teleoperation system allows users to remotely control # a robotic hand using hand gestures captured through a camera.

## Requirements
## Python 3.x
## OpenCV
## BionicHand SDK
## Webcam or camera module
## Operating System: Windows/Linux/Mac
## Setup
## Install Dependencies:

Install Python 3.x on your system.
Install the required Python packages using the following command:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
BionicHand SDK:

Obtain the BionicHand SDK and follow the installation instructions provided by the manufacturer.
Connect Webcam:

Connect a webcam or camera module to your computer.
Usage
Run the Teleoperation Script:

Execute the main teleoperation script:
Copy code
python teleoperation.py
Calibrate the System:

Follow on-screen instructions to calibrate the system. This step ensures accurate hand gesture recognition.
Control the BionicHand:

Once calibrated, use your hand gestures in front of the camera to control the BionicHand.
